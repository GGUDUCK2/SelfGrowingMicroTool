[Project Health Report - 2024-05-19]
## Repository Hygiene
- Moved `add_to_registry.cjs` and `find_latest_tool.js` from the root directory to `scripts/`.
- Validated that the root directory remains clean of `*.py`, `*.log`, and stray screenshots.

## Design Consistency
- Enforced dark mode compatibility by injecting `dark:bg-slate-900`, `dark:text-white`, and related Tailwind classes in `zen-forge`, `unit-verse`, `time-forge`, `qr-forge`, `pomodoro-timer`, `pixel-forge`, `logic-forge`, `icon-forge`, and `glassmorphism-generator`.
- Programmatically injected the `FAQSection` semantic component to `zen-forge`, `subnet-scope`, `schema-forge`, `motion-master`, `id-forge`, and `grid-master` to standardize page layouts and provide deeper context to users.

## AdSense Readiness
- Injected the missing `AdPlaceholder` into all 68 tool pages, intelligently placing it above `FAQSection` or `RelatedTools`.
- Injected `GuideSection` into 30 tool pages, utilizing their respective local dictionary variables (e.g., `dict`, `t`, `toolDict`) to ensure non-breaking string translation compliance. This resolves thin-content issues and maximizes readiness.

## Tech Debt
- Executed `npm audit fix` resolving 1 moderate severity dependency vulnerability (brace-expansion).
- Confirmed stable builds and cross-verified that zero compiler regressions were introduced during programmatic file manipulation.

### [Daily Improvement Report - 2023-10-21]
#### 1. Identified Issues (발견된 문제)
- The project design system color palette was inconsistent, using `blue` instead of the standardized `indigo` color palette.
#### 2. Key Changes (주요 수정 사항)
- Conducted a design system audit and enforced `indigo` over `blue` globally across 52 Svelte components and TS utility files.
#### 3. Performance Impact (기대 효과)
- Enhanced overall UI/UX consistency by unifying the design system color scheme, ensuring a cohesive look and feel across the platform.
