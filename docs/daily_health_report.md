[Project Health Report - 2026-05-10]
## Repository Hygiene
- No Python scripts or unnecessary patch files found to move; repository was largely clean but verified .gitignore.
## Design Consistency
- No design changes were necessary today.
## AdSense Readiness
- Verified that AdPlaceholder components exist in the global layout and that legal pages are populated with substantive text content.
## Tech Debt
- Updated `vite.config.ts` by adding `react-native-fetch-blob` to external dependencies, resolving a persistent Vite build warning from pdf-lib.
- Fixed Svelte ESLint parse errors (`Unterminated string constant`) in `time-forge`, `type-forge`, and `unit-verse` by collapsing multi-line `JSON.stringify` logic inside `{@html}` script tags into a single line.
